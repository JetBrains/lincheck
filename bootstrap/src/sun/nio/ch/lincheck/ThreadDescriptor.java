/**
 * Represents a descriptor for a thread, containing metadata requited for
 * the Lincheck analysis of the thread execution.
 *
 * <p>
 * The thread descriptor can be registered in the thread registry and then retrieved at any point,
 * using the static methods of this class:
 * - {@link ThreadDescriptor#setCurrentThreadDescriptor(ThreadDescriptor)}
 * - {@link ThreadDescriptor#setThreadDescriptor(Thread, ThreadDescriptor)}
 * - {@link ThreadDescriptor#getCurrentThreadDescriptor()}
 * - {@link ThreadDescriptor#getThreadDescriptor(Thread)}
 *
 * <p>
 * The registry uses a combination of techniques to associate and retrieve thread descriptors with threads.
 * - For the instances of the {@link TestThread} class, that is threads usually created by the Lincheck itself,
 *   the descriptor is stored in one of the fields of the class.
 * - For the other subclasses of the {@link Thread} class, typically those created by the user code,
 *   the descriptor is stored in the thread-local variable.
 *
 * <p>
 * Moreover, the registry also maintains a global map
 * to store a mapping from each registered thread to its descriptor
 * in a thread-safe and garbage collection-friendly manner.
 * The thread-local variable is used for quick retrieval of the descriptor from within the thread itself,
 * while the global map is used to access a descriptor of the thread from another thread.
