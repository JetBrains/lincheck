     * Searches for invocations of constructors `className::<init>(args)` and inserts bytecode
     * that will extract all objects from `args` which types are subtypes of the class `className`.
     * Snapshot tracker then tracks the extracted objects eagerly.
     *
     * This is a hack solution to the problem of impossibility of identifying whether
     * some object on stack in the constructor is a `this` reference or not.
     * So for instructions `GETFIELD`/`PUTFIELD` in constructors handler of `visitFieldInsn(...)` method below
     * we ignore the accesses to fields which owners are the same type as the constructor owner.
     * The optimization is done to avoid 'leaking this' problem during bytecode verification.
     * But sometimes `GETFIELD`/`PUTFIELD` are invoked on fields with owner objects are the same type as a constructor owner,
     * but which are not `this`. This can happen when:
     * - a non-static object is accessed which was passed to constructor arguments
     * - a non-static object is accessed which was created locally in constructor
     *
     * We only case about the 1nd case, because for the 3nd case when dealing with
     * a locally constructed object it can't be reached from static memory, so no need to track its fields.
     * The 2nd case where such object is passed via constructor argument is handled here.
