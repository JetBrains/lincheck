    /**
     * The LoopDetector class identifies loops, active locks, and live locks by monitoring the frequency of visits to the same code location.
     * It operates under a specific scenario constraint due to its reliance on cache information about loops,
     * determined by thread executions and switches, which is only reusable in a single scenario.
     *
     * The LoopDetector functions in two modes: default and replay mode.
     *
     * In default mode:
     * - The LoopDetector tracks code location executions (using [currentThreadCodeLocationsHistory]) performed by threads.
     * The history is stored for the current thread and is cleared during a thread switch.
     * - A map ([currentThreadCodeLocationVisitCountMap]) is maintained to track the number of times a thread visits a certain code location.
     * This map is also cleared during a thread switch.
     * - If a code location is visited more than a defined [hangingDetectionThreshold], it is considered as a spin cycle.
     * The LoopDetector then tries to identify the sequence of actions leading to the spin cycle.
     * Once identified, this sub-interleaving is stored for future avoidance.
     * - A history of executions and switches is maintained to record the sequence of actions and thread switches.
     * - A [loopTrackingCursor] tracks executions and thread switches to facilitate early thread switches.
     * - A counter for operation execution [totalExecutionsCount] across all threads is maintained.
     * This counter increments with each code location visit and is increased by the hangingDetectionThreshold if a spin cycle is detected early.
     * - If the counter exceeds the [ManagedCTestConfiguration.LIVELOCK_EVENTS_THRESHOLD], a total deadlock is assumed.
     * Due to the relative small size of scenarios generated by Lincheck, such a high number of executions indicates a lack of progress in the system.
     *
     * In replay mode:
     * - The number of allowable events to execute in each thread is determined using saved information from the last interleaving.
     * - For instance, if the [currentInterleavingHistory] is [0: 2], [1: 3], [0: 3], [1: 3], [0: 3], ..., [1: 3], [0: 3] and a deadlock is detected,
     * the cycle is identified as [1: 3], [0: 3].
     * This means 2 executions in thread 0 and 3 executions in both threads 1 and 0 will be allowed.
     * - Execution is halted after the last execution in thread 0 using [ForcibleExecutionFinishError].
     * - The logic for tracking executions and switches in replay mode is implemented in [ReplayModeLoopDetectorHelper].
     *
     * Note: An example of this behavior is detailed in the comments of the code itself.

            it's enough to show events before the cycle and first cycle iteration in the current thread.
            For example,
            [threadId = 0, executions = 10],
            [threadId = 1, executions = 5], // 2 executions before cycle and then cycle of 3 executions begins

            In this situation, we have a spin cycle:[threadId = 1, executions = 3], [threadId = 0, executions = 3].
            We want to cut off events suffix to get:
            [threadId = 0, executions = 10],
            [threadId = 1, executions = 5], // 2 executions before cycle, and then cycle begins
            [threadId = 0, executions = 3],

            So we need to [threadId = 1, executions = 5] execution part to have a hash equals to next cycle nodes,
            because we will take only thread executions before cycle and the first cycle iteration.
