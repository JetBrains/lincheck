/**
 * Enumeration representing the various states of a thread.
 * Loosely corresponds to [Thread.State] with a few changes.
 *
 * - [INITIALIZED] --- the thread was created, registered in Lincheck strategy, and started,
 *     but has not yet reported itself running to Lincheck
 *     (i.e., not yet called [Runner.onThreadStart])
 *
 * - [ENABLED] --- the thread is running under Lincheck analysis.
 *
 * - [BLOCKED] --- the thread was blocked (e.g., due to locks, parking, etc.).
 *
 * - [ABORTED] --- the thread aborted by the Lincheck.
 *      Note that the thread is still running while in this state until it actually finishes,
 *      but the Lincheck no longer tries to analyze the code in this thread.
 *
 * - [FINISHED] --- the thread finished running and reported to Lincheck about it.
 *
 * Here is a state diagram of the thread life cycle in Lincheck:
 *
 *     +-------------+      +----------+      +---------+
 *     | INITIALIZED | ---> | ENABLED |  <--> | BLOCKED |
