/**
 * Represents a pure deterministic method descriptor.
 *
 * This class provides the functionality of `DeterministicMethodDescriptor` to handle
 * deterministic method behaviour where the method result can be computed solely based on its inputs,
 * not modifying them or anything else.
 *
 * The [fakeBehaviour] provides a lambda that defines the behaviour to be executed deterministically
 * when running in the fake mode.
 *
 * @param T The return type of the described method's execution.
 * @property methodCallInfo Information about the method call, including its owner, parameters, and identifying details.
 * @property fakeBehaviour The lambda function that specifies the deterministic behaviour of the method.
