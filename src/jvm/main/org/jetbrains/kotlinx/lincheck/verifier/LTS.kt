/**
 * Common interface for different labeled transition systems, which several correctness formalisms use.
 * Lincheck widely uses LTS-based formalisms for verification, see [AbstractLTSVerifier] implementations as examples.
 * Essentially, LTS provides an information of the possibility to do a transition from one state to another
 * by the specified operation with the specified result.
 *
 * In order not to construct the full LTS (which is impossible because it can be either infinite
 * or just too big to build), we construct it lazily during the requests and reuse it between runs.
 *
 * An [LTS] transition from the specified state by the specified operation
 * determines the possible result and the next state uniquely. Internally, we
 * represent transitions as [[State] x [Actor] x [TransitionInfo]].
 *
 * The current implementation supports transitions by partial operations that may register their request and
 * block it's execution waiting for some precondition to become true. Partial operations are presented in
 * "Nonblocking concurrent objects with condition synchronization" paper by Scherer III W., Scott M.
 *
 * Practically, Kotlin implementation of such operations via suspend functions is supported.

/**
 * The regular `Operation` is represented as a pair of [Actor] and [Result].
 * To support partial methods `Operation` should be extended.
 * A partial operation at first registers it's `request` and then waits for the fulfillment
 * of some precondition to become true to complete it's execution.
 * To be able to make transition by a blocking partial operation
 * it is divided into `request` and `followUp` parts as follows:
 * ```
 * [actor:result] = [actor_request : ticket] + [actor_followUp(ticket) : result]`
 * ```
 * If the required precondition is not yet set, the `request` part of an operation
 * suspends it's execution returning a [ticket] that will later be used to invoke completion
 * of the corresponding followUp.
 * Otherwise, the `request` part completes immediately returning the final result.
 *
 * Example of partial operations:
 * Assume, the rendezvous channel. There are two types of processes:
 * producers that perform `send` requests and consumers, which perform `receive` requests.
 * In order for a producer to `send` an element, it has to perform a rendezvous
 * handshake with a consumer, that will get this element. The consumer semantic is symmetrical.
 *
 * ```
 *  class Channel {
 *      fun send(e: Any)
 *      fun receive(): Any
 *   }
 * ```
 * To make sequential transitions by the blocking `send` and `receive` operations
 * they are divided as was described as above:
 * ```
 * 1. [receive_request():ticket] // `receive` registers it's request and suspends the execution
 * 2. [send_request(1):void]     // `send`'s `request` part completes without suspension as the receiver is already waiting
 * 3. [receive_request(ticket):res] // `receive` completes it's execution
 * ```
