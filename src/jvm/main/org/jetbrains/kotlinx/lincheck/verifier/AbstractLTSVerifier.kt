/**
 * An abstraction for verifiers which use the labeled transition system (LTS) under the hood.
 * The main idea of such verifiers is finding a path in LTS, which starts from the initial
 * LTS state (see [LTS.initialState]) and goes through all actors with the specified results.
 * To determine which transitions are possible from the current state, we store related
 * to the current path prefix information in the special [VerifierContext], which determines
 * the next possible transitions using [VerifierContext.nextContext] function. This verifier
 * uses depth-first search to find a proper path.
