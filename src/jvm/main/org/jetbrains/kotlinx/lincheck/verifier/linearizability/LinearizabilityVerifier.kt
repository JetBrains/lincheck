/**
 * This verifier checks that the specified results could happen if the testing operations are linearizable.
 * For that, it tries to find a possible sequential execution where transitions do not violate both
 * LTS (see [LTS]) transitions and the happens-before order. Essentially, it tries to execute the next actor
 * in each thread and goes deeper until all actors are executed.
 *
 * This verifier is based on [AbstractLTSVerifier] and caches the already processed results
 * for performance improvement (see [CachedVerifier]).
