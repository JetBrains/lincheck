 * This test checks that managed strategies do not try to switch
 * thread context inside methods that are marked as ignored.
 * The ignored method should not be considered as a one that
 * performs reads or writes, so that there is no need to switch
 * the execution after an ignored method invocation.
 *
 * If the ignored method is not processed properly, this test fails
 * by timeout since the number of invocations is set to Int.MAX_VALUE.
