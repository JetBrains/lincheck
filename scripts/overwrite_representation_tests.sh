# This script runs all representation tests in overwrite mode.
# It runs the tests on all jdks and both in trace and non-trace modes,
# in the order jdk8 non-trace -> jdk8 trace -> jdk 11 non-trace -> jdk 11 trace, etc..
# Note that due to current issue (https://github.com/JetBrains/lincheck/issues/500) we skip jdk8 trace.
# Where necessary the output files are created or overwritten.
# One can use this script to verify trace outputs by looking at the local changes after the script ran.
# And commit the changes if accepted, to update test outputs.

# We put JDK 17 on the first place because it is the default JDK version for tests.
# By default, when run on other JDK versions, representation tests will first
# try to compare the output with the default log file (i.e. log file for default JDK version),
# and only if they are not equal a JDK-specific expected log file will be created.
# Thus by first running tests on default JDK version we ensure that the default log file
# always created at the beginning.
#
# JDK 11 is SLOW! So remove it if you don't expect files to change
